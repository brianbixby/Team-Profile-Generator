## Description

This Node.js command-line application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I utilized [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) in working with the user's input, [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for unit testing.
